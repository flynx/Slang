# Slang

_[S]lang is a [s]imple and complete [S]tack [lang]uage._

Slang was designed for three main reasons:
  - a means to experiment with several aspects of language design,
  - an educational tool, to illustrate several programming language concepts in a simple, hands-on manner,
  - fun!
